Mod Page: H10 Food Vendor
https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/21329

Category = Vendors
Name = H10 Food Vendor
Language = n/a
Version = 1.1.0
Author = Irongut
Overview = Adds a vendor to the food stall outside Megabuilding H10 with a selection of food, drink and consumables.
Description =
It always bugged me that Jackie could buy food from the stall outside H10 but V can't and the cook isn't present for most of the game.
Cosmicgale requested I fix this oversight so I've added a vendor to the stall with a selection of food and drink based on what you can see in the front counter. The vendor is at the left counter so she doesn't interfere with V's conversation with Jackie during The Ripperdoc.
Stock refreshes after 1 hour. (game time)

Updates:
    v1.2 Adds basic consumables at 1Cyanide101's request.
    v1.1 Increases the quantity of all items to 5 at ExamModManager's request.

Files

An alternative look for the food vendor is also available as an optional file, see images. Install the main file or the optional file, you only need one.

Both versions overwrite each other so you can swap between them if you want to. I recommend saving away from the food stall before swapping or when you reload you may still see the old appearance at first.
